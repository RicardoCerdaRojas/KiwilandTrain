# KiwilandTrain
The challenge of this project is to provide train users with optimized route information.

The approach to the problem implements a tree structure with nodes to simulate the points or stations

A search algorithm for calculation and optimization. In this case I used Dijkstra's algorithm

### Features

- Calculate distances between several points or elements of a node tree
- Calculate the number of trips a person must make between two given points
- Identify non-existing routes
- Identify routes by establishing a certain number of stops desired by the user.
- Find the shortest distance between two points
- Identify the number of possible routes between two points establishing not to travel more than a certain distance

###Projects in the
